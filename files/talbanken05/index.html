This is the home page for Talbanken05, a modernized version of Talbanken76, 
a Swedish treebank of roughly 300,000 words, constructed at Lund University 
in the 1970s. The treebank comes with no guarantee but is freely available 
for research and educational purposes as long as proper credit is given for 
the work done to produce the material (both in Lund and in Växjö).

	[<a href="Talbanken05_1.1.tar.gz">Download Talbanken05 (Version 1.1)</a>]
	<li><b>NB:</b> The very first release of version 1.1 had a bug in the indexing of 
the CoNLL version. If you downloaded it before 4 June 2006 (and want to use the CoNLL version),
you should download it again. We apologize for the inconvenience and express our gratitude to
Markus Dickinson who spotted the bug.
</ul>
The archive available for download contains the entire treebank (divided into 
sections P, G, IB and SD) in four versions:
<ol>
<li>MAMBA: Original syntactic and lexical annotation, (original text encoding in ISO-8859-1)
<li>FPS:   Flat phrase structure annotation (<a href="http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/projekte/TIGER/TIGERSearch/doc/html/TigerXML.html">TIGER-XML</a> encoding in ISO-8859-1)

<li>Dep:   Dependency structure annotation (<a href="MaltXML.html">Malt-XML</a> encoding in ISO-8859-1 and <a href="http://nextens.uvt.nl/~conll/">CoNLL-X shared task</a> format in UTF-8)
</ol>
Relation to earlier versions:
<ul>
 <li>From <a href="Talbanken05.tar.gz">Version 1.0</a> to 1.1: Version 1.1 includes all 
information from the lexical layer in MAMBA in the part-of-speech annotation in FPS, DPS
and Dep, whereas version 1.0 only includes basic parts-of-speech. In addition, a new
version of Dep has been added in the format used in the 
<a href="http://nextens.uvt.nl/~conll/">CoNLL-X shared task</a> on multilingual
dependency parsing. 
</ul>
Below we give a brief description of the original treebank (Talbanken76), the 
process of conversion, and the three different annotation standards (FPS, DPS, Dep).
The conversion is described more fully in the following papers:

<h1>Talbanken76</h1>

Talbanken76 was originally published as:
<ul>
<li>Jan Einarsson: Talbankens skriftspråkskonkordans (1976)
<li>Jan Einarsson: Talbankens talspråkskonkordans (1976)
</ul>
The data were collected in several projects at Lund University in the 1970s
and the material is described in several publications:
<ul>
<li>Ulf Teleman: Manual för grammatisk beskrivning av talad och skriven svenska (MAMBA) (1974)
<li>Margareta Westman: Bruksprosa (1974)
<li>Nils Jörgensen: Meningsbyggnaden i talad svenska (1976)
<li>Tor G Hultman och Margareta Westman: Gymnasistsvenska (1977)
<li>Jan Einarsson: Talad och skriven svenska (1978)
</ul>
Teleman (1974) describes the analysis principles, while the other books apply these
principles to different authentic materials. 
<p>
Talbanken76 consists of a written language part and a spoken language part 
of roughly equal size. The written language part in turn consists of two sections,
the so-called professional prose section (P), with 
data from textbooks, brochures, newspapers, etc., and a collection
of high school students' essays (G). The spoken language part also
has two sections, interviews (IB) and conversations and
debates (SD). Altogether, the corpus contains close to 300,000 
running tokens.
<p>
The MAMBA annotation scheme consists of two layers, the first 
being a lexical analysis, consisting of part-of-speech 
information including morphological features, and the second
being a syntactic analysis, in terms of grammatical functions. 
Both layers are flat in the sense that they consist of tags 
assigned to individual word tokens, but the syntactic layer also 
gives information about constituent structure, as exemplified in 
the annotation of the sentence <i>Genom skattereformen införs 
individuell beskattning av arbetsinkomster</i> (Through the tax 
reform, individual taxation of work income is introduced): 
<p>
<pre>
*GENOM                  PR        AAPR        
SKATTEREFORMEN          NNDDSS    AA          
INFÖRS                  VVPSSMPA  FV          
INDIVIDUELL             AJ        SSAT        
BESKATTNING             VN        SS          
AV                      PR        SSETPR      
ARBETSINKOMSTER         NN  SS    SSET        
.                       IP        IP          
</pre>
<p>
The first column of annotation is the lexical analysis, while 
the second column is the syntactic analysis. The grammatical 
subject of the sentence is the phrase <i>individuell beskattning
av arbetsinkomster</i> (individual taxation of work income), 
where the head word <i>beskattning</i> (taxation) is assigned 
the simple tag SS for subject, while the pre-modifying 
adjective <i>individuell</i> (individual) is tagged SS and AT 
for adjectival modifier; in the post-modifying prepositional 
phrase, the noun <i>arbetsinkomster</i> (work income) is tagged 
SS and ET for post-modifier, while the preposition <i>av</i> 
(of) is tagged SS, ET and PR for preposition.

</ul>

<h1>Conversion</h1>

The syntactic analysis in Talbanken76 is described by its 
creators as an eclectic combination of
dependency grammar, topological field analysis and 
immediate constituent analysis. This makes it
very suitable for conversion to both 
phrase structure and dependency annotation. The conversion 
has proceeded in three steps:
<ol>
<li> 
The original flat but multi-layered annotation is converted 
   to a bare phrase structure annotation, i.e. a phrase 
   structure with unlabeled nonterminal nodes, and edges labeled 
   with grammatical functions. This conversion is rather 
   straightforward given the partially hierarchical annotation 
   exemplified above.
<li>    
The bare phrase structure annotation is extended to a full
   phrase structure representation by labeling nonterminal nodes
   with syntactic categories. These categories are not part of 
   the original annotation and have to be inferred from 
   other parts of the annotation.
<li> 
The full phrase structure annotation is converted to a 
   dependency annotation using the standard technique with 
   head-finding rules and 
   preserving grammatical functions as edge labels. Head-finding 
   rules are not part of the original annotation scheme and have 
   to be constructed manually.
</ol>

<h1>Phrase Structure Annotation</h1>

The phrase structure annotation, which is the outcome of the second
conversion step, uses a conventional set of phrase types (S, NP, VP,
etc.) in combination with the grammatical functions of the original
MAMBA annotation. The representation allows discontinuous phrases,
although discontinuous constituents are relatively rare in the treebank.
<p>
The phrase structure annotation comes in two versions, one with the
flattest possible trees that can be extracted from the original 
annotation, called Flat Phrase Structure (FPS), 
and one where trees have been deepened by inserting,
e.g., NPs within PPs and VPs within (larger) VPs, 
called Deepened Phrase Structure (DPS). 
In both cases, the conversion has necessitated the introduction
of a small number of new syntactic functions.

 <li><a href="FPSsyn.html">New syntactic functions in FPS</a>
 <li><a href="DPSsyn.html">New syntactic functions in DPS</a>
</ul>

<h1>Dependency Structure Annotation</h1>

The dependency annotation (Dep), which is the outcome of the third conversion
step, consists of terminal nodes connected by edges labeled with 
the same syntactic functions as DPS, extended with the label ROOT 
for words that are not governed by another word in the dependency 
structure. The representation allows non-projective
dependency structures, which are needed to capture discontinuous 
constituents. 
<p>
The conversion from phrase structure to dependency structure
uses a <a href="priority_list.txt">priority list</a> for finding the head of a phrase.

<h2>CPOSTAG, POSTAG and FEATS in CoNLL Format</h2>

In the <a href="http://nextens.uvt.nl/~conll/">CoNLL-X shared task</a> format, information
from the lexical categories in the MAMBA annotation is distributed over 3 fields:
<ol>
<li>Coarse-grained part-of-speech (CPOSTAG)
<li>Part-of-speech (POSTAG)
<li>Features (FEATS)
</ol>
In mapping the part-of-speech tags of the Dep format to the CoNLL-X shared task format,
we have used the following principles:
<ul>
<li>The POSTAG field contains the two-character basic part-of-speech tag from the
MAMBA annotation.
<li>The FEATS field contains the additional two-character feature tags from the 
MAMBA annotation (if any), separated by vertical bars (|).
<li>The CPOSTAG field contains the two-character basic part-of-speech tag from 
the MAMBA annotation <i>or</i> a one-character tag obtained by merging part-of-speech
categories from the original annotation, so that, e.g., "V" generalizes over all
verb tags ("AV", "BV", "HV", etc.). The mapping from POSTAG to CPOSTAG
roughly follows the grouping of the MAMBA scheme itself and is summarized in this 
<a href="tag_map.html">table</a>.  
</ul>
<b>NB:</b> The version of Talbanken05 distributed in CoNLL-X shared task format here
is not identical to the data set used in the shared task itself. The latter dataset
used the two-character tags in both the CPOSTAG and POSTAG and had no information
in the FEATS field.
