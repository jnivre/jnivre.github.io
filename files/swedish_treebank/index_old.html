<h1>Swedish Treebank</h1>

The Swedish Treebank is a syntactically annotated corpus of Swedish, created by merging, harmonizing
and partially reannotating two existing corpora, Talbanken [<a href="#T1">1</a>, <a href="#T2">2</a>] 
and the Stockholm-Ume&aring; Corpus (SUC) [<a href="#SUC">3</a>]. The Swedish Treebank
has been created through a collaboration between the Department of Linguistics and Philology at 
Uppsala University and the School of Mathematics and Systems Engineering at V&auml;xj&ouml; University.
The treebank is distributed by <a href="http://spraakbanken.gu.se/">Spr&aring;kbanken</a> at the 
University of Gothenburg</a> and is freely available for research and education but requires the user 
to have a license for SUC 2.0. 
<p>
Below we begin by describing the overall process of merging, harmonizing and reannotating the two source
corpora, and the way in which this process has determined properties of the synthesized treebank. We then 
go on to describe the following aspects of the treebank and its annotation:
<ul>
 <li>Tokenization and sentence segmentation
 <li>Morphological annotation (parts of speech)
 <li>Syntactic annotation (phrase structure and grammatical functions)
 <li>Encoding format (TIGER-XML)
</ul>
We conclude with acknowledgments and references.

<h2>Synthesizing the Swedish Treebank from Talbanken and SUC</h2>

<b>Talbanken:</b> Talbanken is a syntactically annotated corpus, containing both written and 
spoken Swedish, produced in the 1970s at the Department of Scandinavian Languages, 
Lund University, by a group led by Ulf Teleman. In total, the corpus contains about 
350,000 tokens, divided into 200,000 tokens of written text (professional prose and
high school essays) and 150,000 tokens of spoken language (interviews, debates, and 
informal conversations). The original annotation consists 
of two layers: a lexical layer, with parts of speech and morphosyntactic features, 
and a syntactic layer, with a relatively flat phrase structure and grammatical 
functions. 
<p>
<b>SUC:</b> SUC is a balanced corpus of written Swedish, modeled after the Brown 
Corpus and similar corpora
for English, developed at Stockholm University and at Ume&aring; University 
in a project led by Gunnel K&auml;llgren and Eva Ejerhed.
The corpus consists of 1.2 million tokens of text from a variety of 
different genres, the corpus encoding follows the guidelines of the 
Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), and the annotation includes lemmatization,
parts of speech, morphosyntactic features, and named entities. 
<p>
In order to merge and harmonize these two corpora into the 
Swedish Treebank, we have adopted the following overall strategy:
<ul>
<li>Harmonize tokenization and sentence segmentation by making Talbanken
conform to the principles of SUC.
<li>Replace the lexical annotation layer in Talbanken with a morphological 
annotation according to the SUC guidelines.
<li>Convert the syntactic annotation layer in Talbanken to a more modern format 
and annotate SUC according to the (converted) Talbanken guidelines. 
</ul> 
The overall guiding principle has been to modify SUC as little as possible (given
that it is the larger corpus and also a de facto standard for Swedish) and to make
Talbanken conform to SUC instead of the other way round. The only place where this
is not possible is for the syntactic annotation layer, which is missing in SUC.
<p>
Version 1.0 of the Swedish Treebank includes all of SUC but only the professional 
prose section of Talbanken. The annotation is limited to morphology (parts of speech + 
morphological features) and syntax (phrase structure + grammatical functions). 
The status of harmonization and manual revision is as follows:
<ul>
 <li>Tokenization and sentence segmentation in Talbanken has been modified to fit the principles of SUC.
 <li>Morphological annotation has been manually checked and revised in both Talbanken and SUC. 
 <li>Syntactic annotation has been partially checked in Talbanken (after automatic conversion from 
the old format) but not in SUC, where the syntactic annotation has been performed automatically using
a parser trained on Talbanken after conversion from the old format.
</ul>
In the following three sections, we give a brief description of the guidelines for tokenization 
and sentence segmentation, morphological annotation, and syntactic annotation, respectively.

<h2>Tokenization and Sentence Segmentation</h2>

Tokenization follows the principles of SUC. Words separated by 
whitespace or punctuation in the original text are considered separate tokens, as are 
punctuation marks. Exception is made for abbreviations containing punctuation and/or 
whitespace, which are kept together as one token with whitespace replaced by an underscore,
e.g., <code>t.ex.</code> and <code>t_ex</code>.
<p>
Sentences are segmented according to the principles of SUC, where a sentence is treated as 
the longest sequence of tokens between two major delimiters, defined as one of the punctuation
marks <code>.</code>, <code>?</code>, <code>!</code>, <code>:</code>, or combinations thereof. In addition, list items are treated
as separate sentences.

<h2>Morphological Annotation</h2>

<h2>Syntactic Annotation</h2>

The syntactic annotation of each sentence takes the form of a constituent structure, where 
constituents are labeled with structural categories (phrase types), 
while edges connecting constituents are labeled with functional categories
(grammatical functions) indicating the role of the lower constituent within 
the higher. The set of structural categories used is a small set of conventional
phrase types, such as S for sentence/clause, NP for noun phrase, VP for verb
phrase, etc. The set of functional categories is inherited from the MAMBA 
annotation scheme with a small extension for structures that were not annotated 
in the original version of Talbanken.

 <li><a href="GF.html">Functional categories (grammatical functions)</a>
</ul>

<h2>Encoding Format</h2>

Version 1.0 of the Swedish Treebank is encoded in <a href="http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/projekte/TIGER/TIGERSearch/doc/html/TigerXML.html">TIGER-XML</a> and is limited to two layers of annotation, the morphological and 
syntactic layers, as described above. Future releases of the treebank are likely to use standoff annotation
and include additional annotation layers from the source treebanks. One advantage of the TIGER-XML format
is that it supports easy browsing using <a href="http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/projekte/TIGER/TIGERSearch/">TIGERSearch</a>, a GUI-based tool with advanced search facilities.

<h2>Acknowledgments</h2>

We gratefully acknowledge the work done by the original creators of Talbanken at Lund University

and of SUC at Stockholm University and Ume&aring; University [<a href="#SUC">3</a>, ...], 
without which the Swedish Treebank 
clearly would not have existed at all. The work on synthesizing the treebank has been carried out by 
Joakim Nivre, Be&aacute;ta Megyesi, Sofia Gustafson-Capkov&aacute;, Filip Salomonsson, Bengt Dahlqvist,
and Anna S&aring;gvall Hein at Uppsala University and by Johan Hall and Jens Nilsson at V&auml;xj&ouml;
University. Finally, we want to thank Lars Borin and his team at Spr&aring;kbanken for their help in 
distributing the Swedish Treebank.
