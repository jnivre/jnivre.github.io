Welcome to my home page! I am Professor of Computational Linguistics at [Uppsala University](https://www.katalog.uu.se/profile/?id=N5-800) and Senior Researcher at [RISE](https://www.ri.se/sv/person/joakim-nivre) (Research Institutes of Sweden). 

In my research I try to understand natural language from a computational perspective, focusing on how languages around the world use morphosyntax to encode meaning. 

I am one of the founders of the [Universal Dependencies](https://universaldependencies.org) project, and I lead a working group on multilingual and cross-lingual language technology in the [UniDive](https://www.cost.eu/actions/CA21167/) COST action. 

I am a Fellow of the [Association for Computational Linguistics](https://www.aclweb.org/portal/) and a proud recipient of the Dragomir Radev Distinguished Service Award.
